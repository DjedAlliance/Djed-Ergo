AgeUSD Specificatons
---------------------

In this folder you will find the Ergo specifications of the AgeUSD protocol. The versions start from v0.1 with the bare minimum feature set required for the stablecoin to function and move upward with new functionality added to each version.

This versioning structure is used for two primary reasons:
1. To simplify the process of understanding how the protocol works into smaller chunks.
2. Allow developers/protocol designers to understand the smart contract protocol development process and how one can build on top of simpler protocols.

All of the specifications follow [Ergo Improvement Proposal 6: Informal Smart Contract Protocol Specification Format](https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/blob/master/eip-0006.md).
